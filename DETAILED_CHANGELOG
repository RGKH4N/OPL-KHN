commit893 - doctorxyz - PS2Logo bugfix - Fri Aug 26 11:54:51 2016 -0300
commit892 - doctorxyz - 'Playstation 2' boot logo GUI setting (on/off) Due to its minimal IOP memory footprint, now PS2 Logo is a built-in OPL feature, hosen directly from the GUI (Settings->PS2 Logo->on/off). NB: Even when enabled, it will be displayed if - and only if - there exists a valid disc logo that matches the console's region. - Thu Aug 25 21:01:42 2016 -0300
commit891 - doctorxyz - Gardening - Thu Aug 25 14:22:26 2016 -0300

commit885 - doctorxyz - PS2LOGO flag fixes (in Makefile) - Sun Aug 14 08:41:36 2016 -0300
commit884 - doctorxyz - IOP Memory Usage Warning (works together with Debug Colors). It shows the initial memory usage by the OPL IOP Replacement modules and their optional features (if any), right before booting games. The CDVDFSV+CDVDMAN size depends on mode chosen (from smallest to biggest: HDD, USB and ETH), whereas VMC/PS2LOGO size does not. - Sat Aug 13 19:51:42 2016 -0300
commit883 - doctorxyz - Functions added: guiWarning(GUI) & delay(Util) - Fri Aug 12 11:42:28 2016 -0300
commit882 - doctorxyz - 'Playstation 2' boot logo & startup sound - l_oliveira's code optimizations - Tue Aug 9 00:00:44 2016 -0300
commit881 - doctorxyz - SP193: PS3 BC(Backwards Compatible) fixes http://psx-scene.com/forums/f150/possible-get-opl-work-decently-backwards-compatible-ps3-over-network-155082/ - Mon Aug 8 16:19:43 2016 -0300
commit880 - doctorxyz - 'Playstation 2' boot logo & startup sound Since this feature consumes a few extra IOP RAM bytes, it must be enabled by 'PS2LOGO' Makefile directive. NB: It will be properly displayed only if both disc and console region match. Thanks SP193(tips), l_oliveira(guidance) and Vedita BR(feature request/testing) - Mon Aug 8 10:21:15 2016 -0300
commit879 - doctorxyz - Reduced PS2RD string size in About Screen - Sun Aug 7 18:18:13 2016 -0300
commit878 - doctorxyz - Updated for compiling with latest PS2SDK revision - Thu Aug 4 15:33:21 2016 -0300
commit877 - BatRastard - () Turns out Hommi's ASM is in the PS2SDK as "Exit(0)" so replicating it here is redundant. Sooo uh ... yeah ... ;) - Sat May 14 12:29:00 2016 -0400
commit876 - BatRastard - (*) Changed the "sysExecExit()" function call, reverted it to Hominem's original ASM code. The result is people can use the "Exit" function to go back to OSDSYS/Browser. The IGR Path however can be left empty or used as intended before the OPL/GSM integration. OPL will show a baby-blue screen after an IGR and then boot the ELF if the path is valid. If you get a red screen followed by FMCB reinitializing/rebooting, then your IGR path is invalid. Most likely culprit is a syntax error regarding case-senitivity. Note that only physcial memory cards can be used for valid IGR paths at this time as the bug(s) regarding those paths remain ... - Sat May 14 00:28:03 2016 -0400
commit875 - doctorxyz - GSM 0.38 Core readded (now fully PS2RD compatible)* It is based on 0.38 standalone version and also still rellocatable and per-game based. The DTV576P** and DTV1080P*** vmodes are powered by a replacement code for SetGsCrt. The Skip FMVs (Full Motion Videos) toggle has came back, it is based on NachBrenner's method #1****. *Thanks Vedita BR for asking and testing it. **Without this, only PSTwos (BIOS >= 220) have native support. ***None PS2 natively support it; it has been made possible by SP193 (research & development) and reprep (research). ****TODO: Implement other NachBrenner's methods, maybe merging with per-game OPL's appy_patches. PS: VGA vmodes higher than 60Hz can reduce eye strain, depending on your monitor. - Tue Jan 5 05:19:55 2016 -0500

Changed support for USBExtreme games to use a structure and to not use the buffered I/O functions (which are for text config files). 4. Changed loading of DEV9 to only load when either the Ethernet or ATA interfaces have to be used, so that fat PS2s will not always have their expansion bays activated. 5. Fix from AKuHAK to textures.c, to be more compliant with C. - Sat Oct 17 21:47:36 2015 -0400

commit814 - Jay Jay - Merged ifcaro/open-ps2-loader into default - Sun Aug 2 20:14:16 2015 -0700
commit813 - SP193 - Merged the CallBack Timer setting into Accurate Reads compat mode (applies to everything other than reads), new compat mode (High module storage @ 0x01C00000), EE core linkfile adjusted to have the stack before _end for better manageability, EE core will now always reset stack pointer to _end, and fixed blockSize within fat.c overflowing (resulted in extremely poor performance). - Mon Aug 3 03:31:02 2015 +0800
commit812 - SP193 - Fixed VMC size parameter for USB support, simplified LSN calculation for the first phase of cdrom_read() since integer division will truncate anyway, changed stray memcpy() call in fat.c to mips_memcpy(), fixed (updated) the delete and rename functions within supportbase, and fixed updating of the game list under USB mode after an item has been deleted/renamed. - Mon Aug 3 01:13:56 2015 +0800

commit809 - SP193 - Imported fixes for SMAP (wrong watermark value) and IOMAN (incorrect declaration for lseek) stuff, fixed GSM extension's "ok" button, added patch entry for SRW IMPACT LE, removed NBNS's Rules.make file in favour of the common one, and adjusted in-game FAT driver's parameters and strategy to improve seeking performance. - Sun Aug 2 03:38:49 2015 +0800
commit808 - Jay-Jay - Update more LNG files. - Tue Jul 28 13:29:14 2015 -0700
commit807 - Jay-Jay - restored Makefile changes to default from last pushed commit, sorry - Tue Jul 28 09:13:12 2015 -0700
commit806 - Jay-Jay - added a new word to LNG SRC files so it can be used to replace the word SETTINGS in the footer of main page so it can abbreviated in the LNG files without affecting the same full word in other areas; updated LNG files to include new changes in recent commits; French LNG updated 100% translated. - Tue Jul 28 09:08:30 2015 -0700
commit805 - Woon Yung Liu - Merged in Jay-Jay/open-ps2-loader (pull request #22) - Tue Jul 28 20:11:29 2015 +0800
commit804 - SP193 - Added missing files from previous commit, removed leftover SMB DMA address definition (disused since long ago) and removed leftover code that updated ReadPos (is now updated by CDVDMAN itself, not by the individual drivers). - Tue Jul 28 15:39:25 2015 +0800
commit803 - SP193 - Added a small FAT driver to in-game USB support. USB support no longer needs total disc image defragmentation and all sector sizes should be supported. For as little impact on performance as possible, use as large cluster sizes as possible (up to 64KB). - Tue Jul 28 14:21:03 2015 +0800
commit802 - Jay-Jay - Updating some LNG files. - Mon Jul 27 01:46:03 2015 -0700
commit801 - SP193 - Changed game list-locking mechanism to use a semaphore, game list will now be locked when updated and drawn (mutually exclusive operations), deferred GUI operations will be cleared when the GUI is to be suspended (otherwise a crash might result because the requests would be for the previous GUI instance), fixed ELFLDR (wrong compile-time flags, hence IOP reset missing) by removing the RESET_IOP option, re-ordered code that checks for outstanding deferred GUI operations (guiHandleDeferredOps) to prevent potential crash if the linked-list is modified as it waits for the list to be unlocked (not done here, but IF), lowered the priority of the running thread to 90 in ioBlockOps() as it was starving lower-priority (NETMAN) threads, and removed redundant calls to SifInitRpc() in sysExecElf and sysLaunchLoaderElf. - Mon Jul 27 05:12:21 2015 +0800
commit800 - SP193 - Refactored config reading system to allow reading of config file from RAM (for future use), fixed IOMAN crashing due to the request list being set to NULL as it waits for the process sema to be released, fixed OPL getting stuck if HDLDump server could not be started, refactored directory-creation system to be unified and without the need for a redundant check, changed GSM controls to become read-only if GSM is disabled, completed moving the GSM stuff into pggsm.h, added missing "childproof" target into Makefile, consolidated the different IO handler types into opl.h, updated to build with the latest PS2SDK revision, added support for DNS (for future use and manual static setting will not be saved!), added a setting into opl.h that determiens whether the OPL source is a development version, blocking I/O operations in IOMAN will no longer pause I/O execution (oustanding I/O operations will be completed), the I/O request sema will be locked when the number of I/O requests are counted, error messages will now be cleared when HDLDump server is started, failures to start the HDLDump server will be stated, CFG folder will now be "CFG-DEV" instead for development builds, changed config-handling code to use the limits from config.h for key and value management, and changed network initialization to prevent deadlocks that occur during simultaneous initialization of HDLDump and SMB support. - Sun Jul 26 03:40:05 2015 +0800
commit799 - SP193 - Fixed SMB auto-refresh (CD, DVD and USBExtreme lists checked one-by-one) and refactored code in CDVDMAN and MCEMU for better coherency (USB, SMB and HDD-split up into individual files, for as much as possible). - Sun Jul 12 20:40:11 2015 +0800
commit798 - SP193 - BUGFIX: Replaced all calls (and related macros) to the FILEIO RPC service with FILEXIO. OPL is intermittently unstable when listing games, as the rom0:FILEIO module does not suspend interrupts before the DMA transfers for the dread() and getstat() functions (SONY BUGBUG!!). - Sat Jul 11 03:25:55 2015 +0800
commit797 - SP193 - Fixes: Added check for streaming status into CDVDMAN streaming system (for games that read after starting streaming), fixed broken CDVDMAN debug build, changed ambiguous debug strings in CDVDMAN, fixed length checking of ISO filenames and improved on error-handling code in supportbase.c. - Sat Jul 11 03:17:13 2015 +0800
commit796 - SP193 - Fixed and enhanced streaming support: 1. BUG: sceCdStRead() incorrectly updates the remaining amount to read. 2. BUG: sceCdStRead() may lock up because it clears event flag bit 8 after ReadSectors() is run, but the drive might have re-set the bit before that is done. 3. Moved EE-side streaming support into CDVDMAN to avoid needing to use memcpy into the CDVDFSV DMA buffer. SCEI had two sets of the streaming mechanism for the EE and IOP, but we want to save memory for SMB support. 4. Changed the reading thread signaling system back to using a semaphore because the streaming callback (run from reading thread itself) could not issue another read request directly. The use of SetAlarm introduces a needless delay. - Sun Jun 28 18:18:52 2015 +0800
commit795 - SP193 - Consolidated error codes, added error codes for HDD mode, sync'ed with updates to HDD and PFS from PS2SDK, added workaround for clone/compatible network adaptors and corrected UV coordinates for texture-drawing. - Sat Jun 20 20:06:02 2015 +0800
commit794 - SP193 - Fixed NBNS support (unable to resolve NB names after first attempt), revised timeout clock value and adjusted code to prevent some other race-conditions from occuring, adjusted SMB support initialization code to always retry until the link mode can be set successfully, changed link mode setting and DHCP completion-checking intervals to 1 second (reduce strain on IOP), link mode will now be set once at initialization before the TCP/IP stack is initialized (avoid double-initializing the SMAP). Updated to support the new PS2SDK revision. - Tue Jun 16 21:50:14 2015 +0800
commit793 - SP193 - Fixed SMB intialization when built within VMC support, by moving the SMB initialization function into the "oplsmb" export table. Added new message for Ethernet link errors (no connection). Updated the APA, PFS and USB drivers (changes from PS2SDK). Fixed incorrect address for adjusting the storage location of the UDNL module, within src/system.c. - Sat May 30 13:02:35 2015 +0800
commit792 - SP193 - Moved SMB authentication code into a SMBINIT IOP module, so that SMB code can be modular and won't be part of the EE core itself. Fixed support for the USBLD format under SMB mode, renamed mode 5 to "Emulate DVD-DL", fixed filesystem selection within cdvdman_findfile() for mode 5, fixed NBNS support to check against the transaction ID as specified in the RFCs, changed the EE-side libnbns library into a normal C file for simplicity, and lowered the module storage region so that the occupied region will be as low as possible since SMB authentication code is now in an IOP module. - Thu Apr 16 21:59:05 2015 +0800
commit791 - SP193 - Rolled back the new changes to the UI's behaviour, added error-reporting code (reports READCF* errors) to reading functions within CDVDFSV, got ReadIOPM and ReadChain functions within CDVDFSV to report read progress to the EE library, added a new workaround for the SIF becoming unusable after an IOP reset with ongoing DMA transfers. - Sun Mar 29 16:35:13 2015 +0800
commit790 - SP193 - Updated to use the new SIF register definitions, to support automatic screen switching and hiding, USB, HDD and APP modes are now always enabled, added a toggle for hiding advanced network options, fixed CDVDFSV initialization (Initializing SIF on the main thread causes the IOP reset to stall; refer to SCE docs), fixed open(), dopen(), read(), dread() and getstat() to first wait for the, drive to become ready (and for read, forever attempt to read) to be in-line with the original behaviour of CDVDMAN, DEV9 will no longer be powered-off during IGR, the SIF register BOOTEND flag will now be cleared before every IOP reset, within the EE core to ensure correct behaviour, updated network support to ensure that timeouts are accurate regardless of the current video mode. - Sun Mar 22 19:14:28 2015 +0800
commit789 - SP193 - Updated to support the new PS2SDK revision, changed module management so that only the necessary modules will remain resident in-game, changed unloadPad() to call padEnd() instead of padReset() in order to actually stop the PADMAN RPC service, re-added the "ei" instruction to crt0, fixed the logic that determines whether the IP address config has been changed (When DHCP is enabled, re-arranged the EE core so that modules (0x0009A000) will now be stored after the EE core (0x00088000). - Tue Mar 3 21:35:40 2015 +0800
commit788 - SP193 - Updated to work with the new update to the PS2SDK (mainly with the renaming of the EE PS2IP over SIF RPC library, ps2ip, to ps2ips). - Sat Feb 28 21:32:31 2015 +0800
commit787 - SP193 - Changed OPL to use NETMAN and PS2IPS for full control over the network subsystem, SMAP (re-)initialization will no longer be done whenever unnecessary (valid link state = not needed) and renamed "smap" to become "smap-ingame". - Sat Feb 28 15:58:29 2015 +0800
commit786 - SP193 - Updated to support the new PS2SDK PS2IP module (LWIP v1.4.1) and updated PS2ETH SMAP driver, while yet maintaining support for the (in-game) SMSTCPIP stack which was based on an ancient version of LWIP. - Sat Feb 28 14:38:40 2015 +0800
commit785 - SP193 - Added support for the NBNS protocol, added functions for changing the visibility and type of UI elements without hardcoding the element's index number, changed the keyboard to hide passwords, and adjusted language string and some function names. - Sun Feb 22 16:24:52 2015 +0800
commit784 - SP193 - Added patches for Oneechanbara, Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal and updated SMAP. - Fri Feb 20 13:44:46 2015 +0800
commit783 - SP193 - Removed space-filler code in EESYNC, which is found only in some EESYNC versions, presumed to make up for the lesser space taken up by a Debug SECRMAN module. The export table has been removed too, as no module ever links with it. - Fri Feb 13 15:28:26 2015 +0800
commit782 - SP193 - New compatibility mode 1 (accurate reads) and the user callback will no longer be called during streaming (incorrect behaviour). - Fri Feb 13 15:23:56 2015 +0800
commit781 - SP193 - Fixed IOP resets with command lines that are not NULL-terminated (e.g. SOCOM games), added path-purification for cdrom_getstat(), "untweaked" the TCP/IP stack for GUI mode (better performance), fixed screen rendering (screen cut-off) under 480P mode, fixed default-theme scaling, added/fixed missing/incorrect UI hints. - Sun Feb 1 21:22:41 2015 +0800

commit772 - SP193 - Increased buffer size for path parsing to 32-bytes to handle slightly-malformed paths like how SCE does, fixed broken debug printf() statement, removed unnecessary checks that should be only used for debugging (as SCE doesn't perform them), added an additional backslash to SMB paths for compatibility with some SMB servers and changed the ELF-loading error screen (white) to be always shown regardless of the debug enabled/disabled setting. - Thu Jan 22 21:39:00 2015 +0800
commit771 - Jay Jay - Merged ifcaro/open-ps2-loader into default - Tue Jan 20 15:12:41 2015 -0800
commit770 - SP193 - Changed cdrom_open() to set f->mode to O_RDONLY for games that fail to specify O_RDONLY, re-adjusted the path-sanitizing code to function from only cdrom_open() in order to not affect cdrom_dopen(), and corrected non-compliant behaviour of (in-game) SMB support. Fixes for non-compliant SMB support: 1. Client capabilities, when specified for SetupSessionAndX, will now be the server's reported capabilities AND'ed with the client's. 2. Flags2 of every command will now have the SMB_FLAGS2_32BIT_STATUS bit set. Also so that error codes will be properly handled by packet-sniffers like WireShark. - Tue Jan 20 20:13:51 2015 +0800
commit769 - Jay-Jay - update opl.icn made it smaller in size with help from sav3r and updated icon load png files to match new modified opl logo key - Mon Jan 19 01:39:50 2015 -0800

commit766 - Jay Jay - Merged ifcaro/open-ps2-loader into default - Fri Jan 16 23:29:57 2015 -0800
commit765 - SP193 - Replaced the path-sanitizing code with something closer to the SCE-original, and fixed cdrom_dread() to NULL-terminate the filename. This replacement of the path-sanitizing code is also to get rid of the mistake that I made, which was to directly handle the filename of the file on the disc image, without first copying it out and NULL-terminating it. - Sat Jan 17 12:22:24 2015 +0800
commit764 - SP193 - Fixed DVD-DL detection over SMB for images >4GB, fixed DVD-DL handling for USB and SMB, updated OPL to support the new GCC 3.2.3 toolchain. - Sat Jan 17 12:17:15 2015 +0800

commit735 - SP193 - Rewrote HDD support to use the PS2 APA driver instead of HDLDump's code. HDLDump's code was not designed properly for deleting partitions. - Wed Dec 10 22:37:03 2014 +0800
commit734 - SP193 - Dumbed-down the locking mechanism to use only sync_flag, as the use of the event flag APIs will still not totally protect against simultaneous access from an interrupt handler (It'll probably only fully work if the whole code was run from a syscall, but even SCE never did that). - Sun Nov 30 16:02:34 2014 +0800
commit733 - SP193 - Modified cdrom_read() to minimize the number of copy processes. - Sun Nov 30 15:57:45 2014 +0800

commit731 - SP193 - Fixed sceCdChangeThreadPriority to not change the main thread priority* and added RPC support for it, added thread IDs for OPL's threads**, and added support for a streaming function callback***. *Although the original SCE code was broken there (main thread priority adjusted to 8, but not changed back), it might not work well for OPL because its main thread priority is 15. **For debugging. ***For the new streaming system, which will be implemented in the next commit. - Sun Nov 30 15:29:16 2014 +0800
commit730 - SP193 - Replaced the old signaling system with one that works more like the SCE original, and fixed an age-long offset-calculation bug in CDVDFSV. - Sun Nov 30 15:09:37 2014 +0800

commit721 - Bat Rastard - (*) Whoops! - Sat Nov 8 10:30:24 2014 -0500
commit720 - Bat Rastard - (*) Went to far re-globalizing GSM (*) Fixed compilation error in supportbase.c (*) No activity here for the weekend unless I start feeling better. Seeing chiropractor Monday afternoon, and there's a chance he won't adjust my neck and upper back without an MRI. I'm prepared to sign a waiver; it's hard to get an MRI and the results in a two week window. - Fri Nov 7 22:05:32 2014 -0500
commit719 - Bat Rastard - (*) Re-globalized GSM (*) (SP193) Modified supportbase.c that should grab GSM's settings upon game launch. Keyword being should. Untested as I'm ressurecting a tin of sardines. (*) For some reason, the game label doesn't show up in the "Configure GSM" screen. Ignore it for now. - Wed Nov 5 19:51:47 2014 -0500
commit718 - Bat Rastard - (*) Per-Game GSM Complete (I think). There were two solutions to the issue. I made a test build for RandQalan based on "Solution One" and pushed this commit based on "Solution Two" that I'll be testing shortly. I have slightly higher confidence in "Solution Two" as it only changes my integration and clean up code, and leaves "guiShowGSConfig()" alone (as opposed to "Solution One" which alters "guiShowGSConfig()" and leaves the integration and clean up code alone). Expect an OBT real soon! - Mon Nov 3 23:31:15 2014 -0500
commit717 - Bat Rastard - Merged ifcaro/open-ps2-loader into default - Mon Nov 3 15:34:49 2014 -0500
commit716 - SP193 - Improved IGR stability (E P), fixed MC slot 1 use when a VMC is mounted as the 2nd slot (E P), fixed art drawing, fixed poor game list loading performance and brought forward texture cache initialization. Other notes: 1. A stray line was draw for game art covers as their UV coordinates were not centered. 2. Poor game list loading performance resulted from the GUI taking up too much CPU time, so the main thread's priority was lowered. 3. Texture cache initialization was originally done after the game lists and art are loaded. However, that would take a long time if the user has a long of games and/or art, leaving the user to stare at a blank screen. It has been moved forward so that the user will get to see at least the OPL logo, as a sign that OPL is alive and running. - Mon Nov 3 21:35:05 2014 +0800
commit715 - Bat Rastard - Added tag 0.9.3 for changeset 1fbd6857681b - Sat Nov 1 10:26:48 2014 -0400
commit714 - Bat Rastard - (*) Per-Game GSM (In One Commit) - couldn't make sense of the shit I had committed in phases. So I made a backup, restored, remerged, and stripped the previous "phase" commits. All the previous issues still remain. It looks like I need something in "hddsupport.c" in the game launch section but I can't be certain anymore ... (*) Anything else from the 'phase' commits that was not GSM related was removed in order to make sync-merging life easier. SP193 has outstanding commits to Ifcaro that he'll most likely push by Monday. - Sat Nov 1 10:26:12 2014 -0400
commit713 - SP193 - Replaced all obsolete Makefile rule files with a common file and integrated the discID module into the EE side. - Tue Oct 14 22:29:01 2014 +0800
commit712 - SP193 - Changed auto-refresh behaviour and fixed the SMB reconnect option: 1. USB mode will always have auto-refresh enabled, regardless of the setting. 2. SMB mode's auto-refresh has been changed to 300 frames. 3. The SMB reconnect option has been fixed; it will appear even after an error 300 (connection error) occurs. - Sun Oct 12 23:13:38 2014 +0800
commit711 - SP193 - Updated the GUI to have device-dependent refresh rates and moved some of the static buffers in CDVDMAN onto the stack. 1. The device-dependent refresh rates is to cater for the unique needs of the different interfaces. 2. Improved on USB device detection, by increasing the frequency of polls on the USB device and using the new USBHDFSD APIs that allow the software to check on the USB device's status. This should allow faster detection of connects/disconnects without significantly increasing the strain on the IOP. 3. Some of the buffers (Within cdvdman_locatefile and related functions) in CDVDMAN were shrunk and moved onto the stack to reduce its memory footprint. - Fri Oct 10 23:19:40 2014 +0800
commit710 - Woon Yung Liu - README edited online with Bitbucket - Tue Oct 7 09:20:45 2014 +0000
commit709 - Woon Yung Liu - README edited online with Bitbucket - Tue Oct 7 09:18:40 2014 +0000
commit708 - SP193 - Fixed DEVCTL code handling in CDVDMAN, syntax errors and SMB mode error handling when there isn't a network adaptor attached. - Tue Oct 7 16:57:28 2014 +0800
commit707 - SP193 - Improved on the reliability of USB support, added more error messages for SMB and removed VSYNC mode: 1. I've attempted to make USBHDFSD follow the USB Bulk-Only Transport standard, so that it will not freeze when dealing with malfunctioning devices. 2. SMB support now has new error codes: 304 and 305. 3. The VSync setting has been removed, so that the main thread will sleep and give the lower-priority threads CPU time. - Tue Oct 7 01:57:13 2014 +0800
commit706 - SP193 (ysai187 - Fix for Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex. Raised thread priorities of the TCP/IP stack and USB modules, to work around the bug in games like Crash Bandicoot: they have thread(s) that busy-loop. MUST BE COMPILED WITH THE NEW PS2SDK REVISION. - Mon Oct 6 00:00:36 2014 +0800
commit705 - SP193 (pirorin187 - Fixes: 1. The CDVDMAN callback timer is not initialized if the user does not input a value. 2. DiskID within CDVDMAN is not copied properly (started at offset 1 instead of 0). - Sun Oct 5 08:31:44 2014 +0800
commit704 - sp193 (pirorin187 - Fixes and optimizations: 1. Fixed the poweroff behaviour when IGR is disabled. 2. Optimized CDVDFSV and CDVDMAN to use switch/case statement blocks instead of just hardcoded jump tables, in order to allow the compiler to decide on the best way to optimize the modules. 3. Removed code from the GUI's ioman module which dealt with manual thread-switching. 4. Reduced the stack sizes of CDVDMAN's internal threads. - Sat Oct 4 09:39:20 2014 +0800
commit703 - sp193 (pirorin187 - Rewritten the patching system and how parameters are passed to IOPCORE, for maintainability. Other fixes/enhancements: 1. Corrected the ID for Super Robot Wars IMPACT. 2. Modified USBHDFSD to use iomanX, so that the rename function can be accessed by OPL. The rename function should now be working for USB devices. 3. When IGR is disabled, pressing the power button should switch off the console. - Sat Oct 4 03:45:38 2014 +0800
commit702 - Woon Yung Liu (pirorin187 - Added a patch for Super Robot Wars IMPACT, and optimized CDVDMAN's callback functionality. Special thanks to SilverBull for the patch details! - Fri Oct 3 05:35:49 2014 +0800
commit701 - sp193 (pirorin187 - Fixed CDVDMAN initialization. Fixes: SSX World Tour and the Harry Potter series. - Tue Sep 30 08:54:16 2014 +0800
commit700 - sp193 (pirorin187 - Updated USBHDFSD to support disks >1TB and <=2TB (Sync'ed with PS2SDK update). - Tue Sep 30 01:01:15 2014 +0800
commit699 - sp193 (ysai187 - Corrected path handling, which was broken in commit e5e85f0. Added the missing udnl_asm.s file to udnl-t300, for DTL-T10000 support. - Sun Sep 28 09:44:28 2014 +0800
commit698 - sp193 - Fixes and updates: 1. Updated to use the updated USBD module from the PS2SDK, which has been fixed to support the PS3 and appears to not suffer from that pause which occurs whenever any of its previous versions load. 2. Removed support for the USB delay option. I think that it's just working around a threading problem within CDVDMAN, which I've solved by adding a call to DelayThread() within the USB device initialization loop. That should give the USB drivers CPU time and not freeze up the IOP. 3. Updated the GUI to use an enum for its GUI IDs, so that the code will be easier to maintain and would be neater. - Mon Sep 8 20:36:57 2014 +0800
commit697 - sp193 - in-game SMB fixes and enhancements: *Fixed the size of the WriteAndXRequest structure of the SMB module. *Attempted to replace most of the hardcoded values with sizeof() statements. *Optimized SMB support by hardcoding some of the fixed values, to save CPU time during reads and writes. - Wed Aug 20 22:47:26 2014 +0800
commit696 - SP193 - Added an option for DTL-T100dded an option for DTL-T10000 support, since this unit can have a different set of IOP modules in its flash ROM. The option will cause OPL to not use the undocumented SIO2 modules from ROM (SIO2MAN, MCMAN, MCSERV and PADMAN). The IOP will be also reset with "rom0:UDNL" as the command instead, in order to get the TOOL to load the standard debugstation modules. ibootp must be set to 0x100 and ebootp to 0x000F0000. - Mon Aug 4 13:07:19 2014 +0800
commit695 - doctorxyz - SP193: FreeType fix - Sat Jul 12 16:07:03 2014 -0300
commit694 - doctorxyz - More Makefile fixes - In order to CHILDPROOF, RTL, GSM and CHEAT switches work properly - Wed Jul 9 19:37:45 2014 -0300
commit693 - doctorxyz - Makefile fix to build without PS2RD Cheat Engine (CHEAT = 0) - Wed Jul 9 15:43:00 2014 -0300
commit692 - doctorxyz - EE Core - Only Install PadOpen Hook if IGR is enabled - Fri Jul 4 08:47:43 2014 -0300
commit691 - SP193 - Merged doctorxyz's commit with mine. I've also removed the old alternate EE core Makefile and linkfile, and replaced the "sync; ei" instruction sequence within ee_core/src/padhook.c with ExitHandler(). - Thu Jun 26 19:13:48 2014 +0800
commit690 - doctorxyz - OPL+PS2RD Cheat Engine Integration - Mon Jun 23 08:20:53 2014 -0300
commit689 - SP193 - Updated OPL to compile with the new PS2SDK. Applied the month field fix to the USBHDFSD, HDD and PFS modules, as well as OSDHistory.c. The old CDVDMAN module does not automatically file off the most significant bit of the month field, hence why it must be done. Removed vmc/mcman, since it is unused and seemed to not be special... - Mon Jun 23 18:39:24 2014 +0800
commit688 - SP193 - Fixed the theme bug and improved code: 1. Theme-loading bug fixed: the theme setting will not get reset if the video mode and/or VSYNC setting(s) are not left at their defaults. 2. Rewrote OPL to not used hardcoded buffer length values when invoking functions like strncmp, strncpy and snprintf. 3. Renamed include/usbld.h to include/opl.h. - Sun Jun 15 18:52:00 2014 +0800
commit687 - SP193 - Sync'ing with the PS2SDK commit for today: the main point behind this commit is the rollback of the use of the pre and post-DMA callbacks within DEV9, for compatibility with a certain clone adaptor. The rest of the changes are related to the (minor) bugfixes from the PS2SDK commit. - Tue Jun 10 21:47:33 2014 +0800
commit686 - Woon Yung Liu - Merged in psx_core/open-ps2-loader/psx_core/the-most-accurate-and-correct-translatio-1384761167035 (pull request #6) - Sun Jun 1 19:35:01 2014 +0800
commit685 - SP193 - Fixed a buffer overflow problem in CDVDFSV and refactored all CDVDMAN defines: 1. In CDVDFSV, the code that reads data into the buffer defined by CDVDFSV_BUF_SECTORS can actually read up to CDVDFSV_BUF_SECTORS+1. This resulted in CDVDMAN's buffer overflowing. 2. In the process of remedying the problem, I've moved all the common CDVDMAN definitions from cdvdman.c and cdvdfsv.c into common/cdvdman.h, to reduce redundancy and to improve coherency. 3. Updated the README file of the UDNL module. - Fri May 9 21:50:36 2014 +0800
commit684 - SP193 - Added a proper patch for Choujikuu Yousai Macross (SLPM-65405). - Thu May 1 17:01:58 2014 +0800
commit683 - SP193 - Completed the integrated DECI2 debugging system and updated some log messages. 1. The UDNL module is now the first module in the module list. This is so that the DECI2-enabled version of this module can be moved into kernel RAM when required. 2. An integrated DECI2 debugging system has been added. It is based on RDB, which makes it share the same limitations as the Sony TDB startup card. 3. However, it seems like there may be problems with the ingame SMAP driver. It might be the old bug (where the network stack stops responding), since the problem now is that the network interface becomes totally unusable if DECI2 is loaded. 4. As a result, the normal SMAP driver will be used if DECI2 debugging is used. - Tue Apr 22 00:57:53 2014 +0800
commit682 - SP193 (pirorin187 - Completed the incomplete modifications from the previous commit + enhanced IGR. 1. The new EE core was supposed to use the embedded UDNL module instead because the one in ROM does not disable DMA. USB support suffers because its DMA channel is capable of transfers without the IOP. 2. Added prototype DECI2 support (integrated RDB), but it is currently dysfunctional because there isn't enough EE RAM to store everything. Still a WIP... 3. Modified IGR to not hook threads during LoadExecPS2() and IOP resets. Also done for the sake of performance in SMB mode. 4. Re-added these instructions to the ends of interrupt handlers: "ei" and "sync". I was wrong about them not being required, after studying the Sony documents thoroughly. - Mon Apr 21 22:21:07 2014 +0800
commit681 - SP193 (pirorin187 - changes.txt - Sat Apr 19 13:52:29 2014 +0800
commit680 - SP193 (pirorin187 - Updated OPL to be fully compatible (compiles without the deprecated warnings) with the HEAD revision of the PS2SDK. There should be no differences in functionality from the previous revision. - Sat Jan 11 20:27:05 2014 +0800
commit679 - psx_core - The most accurate and correct translation from english to russian by RA1n. (lang_Russian.lng edited online with Bitbucket) - Mon Nov 18 07:52:59 2013 +0000
commit678 - SP193 (pirorin187 - *Changed the configGetString function to return a const value, since the configuration keys are not to be changed without configSetStr(), except for two lines within themes.c. This is to safeguard against accidental configuration corruption/overwriting. *Added a slightly modified version of the OSD game history updating system from FMCB, although it's disabled because it still isn't working right. - Wed Nov 6 13:16:17 2013 +0800
commit677 - BatRastard - * Updating LNG files - Ethernet modes (among other things) were missing. * Reverting Arabic LNG with a backup. RTL probably broken. Hopefully, our   Arabic users will know how to fix it themselves. I'm tired of fighting   with it all. * CHANGELOG and DETAILED_CHANGELOG updated. - Fri Nov 1 12:42:36 2013 -0400
commit676 - sp193 - Reverting the change in the previous commit. - Fri Nov 1 20:32:26 2013 +0800
commit675 - sp193 - Fix for the workaround for the Chinese SATA network adaptor: I forgot that the register is 16-bit, which means that the adaptor probably reports 0xFFFF as its version number. - Fri Nov 1 17:43:16 2013 +0800
commit674 - sp193 - *Ported over the workaround for Chinese SATA network adaptors (See the PS2SDK update for today). *png_init_io() is now called instead of png_set_read_fn() with a NULL value specified as the function argument. While the results are similar, it's probably not a good idea. *(mark_k) Replaced all PNG images with optimized PNG images (Optimized with PNGOUT), to save space. - Fri Nov 1 13:47:59 2013 +0800
commit673 - BatRastard - * Rev672 tapped for release - updated changelogs. - Fri Oct 25 17:52:49 2013 -0400
commit672 - SP193 (pirorin187 - *Replaced the TLB reinitialization mechanism with a built-in one. No more patching/hooking onto the EE kernel for that! Done partly for compatibility with the PSX. *Cleaned up code (Removed unreferenced definitions). *Changed all long ints in ee_core/src/des.c to just integers to save space and for the performance. *Removed leftover derelict GSM-enabling code from elfldr. *Ported the loader (elfldr in OPL) from FMCB v1.93, since I had already refined the loader there. *Fixed the saving of the result code from the SMB logon step. The correct SMB connection/logon error message should be displayed now. *Changed SysExecElf() to not accept any arguments since it was previously not coded properly to support that. No caller function every used that functionality anyway. - Thu Oct 24 15:13:40 2013 +0800
commit671 - BatRastard - * Hey Bat! Try not to commit non-default changes to Makefiles next time, will   ya! ;) - Tue Oct 22 14:06:16 2013 -0400
commit670 - BatRastard - * MASSIVE UPDATE - Consider deleting and re-cloning your local repos if   "hg pull -u" gives you merge issues! * Re-integrated GSM core (Version 0.36.R). This GSM core removes support for   576p, 1080p, any mode supported by 0.37. and 0.38. This is temporary as   GSM 0.38 is being reworked for more robust and stable re-integration. * GSM's "Skip FMVs" is no longer functional with this core, but it wasn't   removed since that could break something else, and it'll be coming back   anyway upon upgrading GSM back to 0.38 at a later date. * Modified Makefile - GSM not included in "Childproof" builds. * Modified GUI to refresh Main Menu when configuration is re-loaded. This fixes   a quirk where HDLSERV and GSM Settings didn't appear immediately. * Vanilla OPL no longer displays GSM-related functions such as the toggle and   GSM Settings Menu. * Launching a GSM-build of OPL after an IGR from Vanilla OPL could result in a   BSOD. Probably related to GSM and EELOAD. Powercyle the PS2 beforehand. * GSM-builds are now IGR compatible due to the 0.36.R core (YAY!) * Alpha tests reveal possible issues with SCPH-39006 and SCPH-15000 models not   launching OPL that may be related to either ps2-packer or GUI modifications   that were made to disable GSM-related options when "GSM=0" is set in the   Makefile. We need more test reports to determine the true nature of the beast   or if was just a one-off quirk. Considered a bug nonetheless ... - Tue Oct 22 13:55:08 2013 -0400
commit669 - BatRastard - * Massive changes to GSM function calls - some of which were so similar that   they made ongoing progress about as fugly and frustrating as peeling apart a   grilled cheeze. So "gGSM" is now "gEnableGSM" and the previous EnableGSM()   is now StartGSM(), and so on and so forth. We needed some linguistic distance   between "Enabling/Disabling" a GUI function and "Starting/Stopping" a   module/service/thread etc. (Sorry if too drastic, SP193) ... * Rephrased some GSM menu items and hint dialog. * Massive lang refesh - again ... - Mon Oct 21 17:29:56 2013 -0400
commit668 - BatRastard - * Anticipating blood-curdling scream from SP193! * Changed GSM toggle to "Show GSM on Main Menu" * Fixed the configSetStr() for GSM toggle * Temorarily restored some #ifdefs to system.c - they exist for the sake of   Vanilla OPL *ONLY*. It fails to compile due to GSM's function calls not   being properly defined via headers, thus throwing "undeclared function"   and "explicit declaration" warnings when compiling Vanilla OPL is attempted   (i.e. when "GSM=0" in the Makefile). * Cue blood-curdling scream from SP193! ;) * Joins SP193 in blood-curdling scream! *LOL* - Fri Oct 18 12:43:06 2013 -0400
commit667 - BatRastard - * Cleaned up GSM code * Removed redundant #ifdefs - Wed Oct 16 17:05:23 2013 -0400
commit666 - BatRastard - Added tag 0.9.2 for changeset 3eb5ac59e7a5 - Sat Oct 12 06:59:14 2013 -0400

commit664 - BatRastard - (*) Aaaand after a half-assed busted GUI staring me dead in the face for over     week, the new "GSM Settings" on Main Menu item and "Reveal GSM On Main Menu"     toggle in "Settings" is LIVE! (and boy am I'm tired of looking at it! ;)     Once enabled, press Start twice on Main Menu to refresh the GUI ... (*) Repository frozen; ready for merge into Ifcaro ... - Fri Oct 11 17:49:17 2013 -0400
commit663 - BatRastard - Updating CHANGELOG ahead of release - actual release revision can be added when necessary. Saves us some tedium. - Wed Oct 2 11:29:13 2013 -0400
commit662 - BatRastard - * Rebase complete * Using unified Makefile - OPL and OPLGSM compiles from single source. * Vanilla OPL builds from this base will contain GSM settings under   "Display Settings" but toying with them could prove catastrophic as the    integrated GSM is not embedded when "GSM=0" is set in the Makefile. This    was done to preserve compatbility with PS2RD/Codebreaker. It is   HIGHLY recommended you leave "VMODE" to AUTO and ignore the GSM settings   completely. A future revision/release will contain a GSM on/off toggle   in "Settings" that'll automatically hide/display GSM options here much like   HDLSERV is hidden unless "Enable Rename and Delete" is on. * OPLGSM builds from this codebase should function properly with the usual   caveats such as IGR causing a problem with the GS chip on the PS2 that   triggers an IOP crash and incompatibility with CB/PS2rd. Also, there's a   chance that loading builds of OPLGSM from this codebase after IGRing from   a vanilla OPL build may cause a BSOD. Powercycle the PS2 first prior to   launching builds of OPLGSM from this code base if you experiance this. - Tue Oct 1 16:43:01 2013 -0400
commit661 - SP193 (pirorin187 - *Modified compatibility mode 7 to not affect sceCdStRead(), as the streaming functions are already underperforming. *Updated the detailed changelog. - Wed Oct 2 00:17:01 2013 +0800
commit660 - SP193 (pirorin187 - *Sync'ing the HDD module updates for the PSX. OPL should now run properly on the PSX. *Updated the HDPro ATAD module. *Removed the old compatibility mode 7 code. *Added a new compatibility mode 7: IOP threading hack. This is applicable to only the HDD mode, and basically causes a thread context switch (to give other threads more CPU time) before every read is made. This fixes stuttering in some games like DDR and Pop 'n Music. *CDVDFSV had its internal functions declared as static, and function type definitions have been added for the jump tables within it. - Tue Oct 1 23:04:45 2013 +0800
commit659 - SP193 (pirorin187 - *Sync'ing HDD updates... again. *Updated modules/hdd/ps2hdd. I just realized that it wasn't updated in a long time. - Sun Sep 29 19:22:24 2013 +0800
commit658 - SP193 (pirorin187 - *Sync'ing the updates in the PS2SDK with the ATAD modules here: common/include/atahw.h was updated, and all ATAD modules are using the commands defined within atahw.h. *Removed the "UDMA 5" and "UDMA 6" transfer modes from the UI, since the PlayStation 2 never supported those modes. *Updated SMB support to have better error messages for the common connection problems. *The network error codes have been changed slightly: 300 for connection errors, 301 for logon errors, 302 for errors related to the ECHO isalive test failing, and 303 for share opening errors. - Fri Sep 27 18:22:17 2013 +0800
commit657 - sp193 (ysai187 - *Optimized CDVDMAN (Declared internal structures and functions as static). *Replaced inline assembly code that invokes syscall #14 with a call to SetVCommonHandler. *Removed the code that plays with the system initialization/restarting functions. That was put in place because the unpatched Protokernels had a ExecPS2() syscall that didn't clean up the kernel. With the complete Protokernel patch, this entire system is redundant. *Replaced code within the UI that manually powers off the DEV9 interface and the console with a simple call to poweroffShutdown(). *Modified the TLB initialization code to use _InitTLB (syscall #130) instead, if the amount of EE RAM is not 32MB. This is for compatibility with the PSX (DVR unit). *(doctorxyz): Fixed the Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix JPN Gummi Ship missions patch. *(doctorxyz): Exiting from the main menu will use the IGR exit path as well. *(doctorxyz): All coloured debug screens within the EE core will be disabled, when they are to be disabled. *(doctorxyz): Fixed Makefiles of those modules that generate map files to delete the mapfiles when they are cleaned up. - Mon Sep 2 15:21:49 2013 +0800
commit656 - sp193 (ysai187 - The original files I modified couldn't be committed directly into the repository, so I had to check out a new copy of the repository and copy my changes over manually. Unfortunately, I forgot to copy the changes for SMAP driver in the UI. Sorry. - Thu Aug 8 14:22:12 2013 +0800
commit655 - sp193 (ysai187 - *Updated ATAD (Normal ATAD and the HDPro version) to be the same as the ones from the PS2SDK. *Replaced the SMAP driver: 	1. modules/network/smap is a modified version of the ps2eth/smap-new driver, with the thread removed and with inline assembly to speed up word copying to and from the FIFOs. 	2. ps2eth/smap-new will be used for the UI, as it has better support for handling changes in the link state. 	3. smstcpip was modified to be support both SMAP drivers (Packed input within the normal thread context for the smap-new driver, and within the interrupt context for the modules/network/smap driver). *Added comments regarding the modified lwip_recvfrom function (It was always modified, but nobody mentioned that). *Removed code that transfers data to the uncached segment from CDVDMAN/smb.c. The uncached segment is a EE-thing, and doesn't refer to physical memory. *Ported a modified version of the Ethernet speed and duplex setting override control from doctorxyz's branch. - Thu Aug 8 14:12:32 2013 +0800
commit654 - sp193 (ysai187 - *Re-added SPU reset code. CLEARSPU shouldn't be used and I was wrong about that. *Removed cache flush from the pad hooking code, using the uncached segment instead. This should reduce the impact IGR has on the EE. *Removed sync and ei instruction from the end of the IGR VBLANK_END INTC handler. Why does it have to be there and won't it be bad to change the processor state there? I never needed to use such instructions in any of my VBLANK interrupt handlers. :/ - Sun Jul 21 12:12:43 2013 +0800
commit653 - sp193 (ysai187 - *Added sceCdPowerOff().

commit646 - sp193 - *Removed the old Protokernel patch, since a full patch has been integrated into the PS2SDK. *Removed support for "loaders" within the CRT0 of the EE core. It will never be started from a thread, hence it's redundant. - Thu Mar 21 00:08:41 2013 +0800

commit582 - Hominem te esse - ItemsList can now use clipping too. As a result, the "items" option for ItemsList has been removed. Now to limit the number of items being displayed, specify a "height" value. - Sat Mar 5 22:10:20 2011 +0100
commit581 - Hominem te esse - * caching of last attribute value (for AttributeText/Image element), to not search the config file every frame * drawing text (font) do not use rmSetupQuad anymore, wasn't needed anyway (Also reduced branching for Pixmap/quad) * Image element have a new "scaled" option to define if the drawing of the Image should respect the screen scaling policy (for 4:3, or 16:9 adaptation). Background element use "scaled=0" by default to take the full screen width and height. * drawing text can used two mode for limiting the text size. When an element have a "width" or "height" defined, by default we use "clipping" (everything larger than width or height will not be drawn). With the "wrap=1" option for text element, you can change this default behavior to wrap the text instead. Finally if you don't define width/height, the full text wil be drawn, without any check. * Element width and height definition can use the string "DIM_INF" to mean "maximum/infinite" (bound to the max screenwidth/screenheight). This is to be used instead of putting the real max screen width/height (as "heigth=512"), as they may change depending of the use of NTSC/PAL. - Sat Mar 5 19:11:31 2011 +0100

commit243 - polo35 - IGR2 Fix 4. -Use Hook_ExecPS2 and Hook_CreateThread to install IGR.  This might solve pink-green flicker problem, and increase IGR compatibility. -Modify Find_pattern_with_mask function to compare 32bits at a time instead of 8bits.  No more search mistake, and increase IGR installation speed. -Modify thread priority management when IGR is call.  IGR thread is created with prio=127, (lowest) to not interfere with other threads.  When IGR is call, all thread are suspended, and prio are set to 127.  Then, IGR thread is woken-up, and prio is set to 0. (highest) -Add padOpen function check before calling it.  Some game execute ELFs, so old padOpen function can remain in memory.  This check ensure function is still available before calling it. -Add ability to patch padOpen function called with a simple Jump (J) instead of a JumpAndLink (JAL). (Armored Core: Nine Breacker) -Add ability to patch padOpen instuction code.  Some game use an address table to call functions. (Ratchet & Clank: Size Matter) -Add libpad2 2.7.0.0 pattern.
